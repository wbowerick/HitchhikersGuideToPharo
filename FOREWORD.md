# Foreword

If you look up into the night sky you might feel very small. There is an infinite space with stars out there making you think about life, universe and everything. You might ask yourself the usual questions 

 - Why are we here?  
 - Are eyebrows considered facial hair?  
 - Why is the naked mole-rat not regulating its body temperature in a typical mammalian fashion?  
 - Why did the chicken cross the road?  
 - Is Scroedingers cat its own witness?  
  
Even when this book is called a guide reading it does not necessarily mean it can give you all the answers \(who would be 42 anyway\). So why should you read this book then?
