# Pharo ZeroConf

Installation of software can be cumbersome especially when you have to download several components and also see that they fit together. 

Exactly this is what Pharo ZeroConf tries to address. Basically it is a webpage at [http://get.pharo.org](http://get.pharo.org) that you can use to easily script the installation of necessary Pharo components like the image file or the virtual machine.
