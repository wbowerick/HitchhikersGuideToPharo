# Pharo ZeroConf

Installation of software can be cumbersome especially when you have to download several components and also see that they fit together. Would'nt it be better if I could run a simple command line script that fetches the correct versions for me? Exactly this is what Pharo ZeroConf tries to address.

Basically Pharo ZeroConf is a webpage at [http://get.pharo.org](http://get.pharo.org) that you can use to easily script the installation of necessary Pharo components like the image file or the virtual machine.
