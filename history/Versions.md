# Pharo Versions

 
## Pharo 0.1 

Pharo started with a fat Squeak image - throwing out packages like Speech support, Flash, and others that were either unmaintained or loadable afterwards as an external package. This had the positive effect of reducing the size of the fat image file drastically.

Also the initial Pharo was harvesting many fixes who (at that time) have not yet found their way into official Squeak releases - adding more stabilization to the image. 

But the early Pharo community also quickly harvested improvements on the UI side to get rid of the colorful windows look of Squeak that was often seen as too toyish and unprofessional.

One early inofficial milestone was the Pharo 0.1 Demo including the Polymorph theming framework and support for True Type Fonts:

This lead to some wider acceptance and more people got interested in the new project.
