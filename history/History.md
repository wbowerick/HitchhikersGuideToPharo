# The history of Pharo

Pharo originally started in **May 2008** as a fork of the **Squeak** Open Source Smalltalk system. It started as a fork of the Squeak image formed by a group of developers that wanted to go a different route than other parts of the community. 

One has to go back in time a little bit to understand the computing history and full story of Pharo and its relationship to its ancestors:

## Smalltalk

During the 1970s at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) a system called Smalltalk was invented by a team around computer scientist [Alan Kay](like Smalltalk 71, Smalltalk 72 and Smalltalk 76). Smalltalk was not only an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming system - it was and still is one of the most influential programming languages. 

While Alan primarily worked on the design of Smalltalk the early implementations of his ideas were done by computer pioneer **Dan Ingalls** leading to Smalltalk Systems like Smalltalk 71, Smalltalk 72 and Smalltalk 76.



The orginal team included also Adele Goldberg who helped document the system as well as Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others.

## Squeak

VPRI,
Etoys

- Squeak 3.9 maintainers like Marcus, many bug fixes were harvested,
- Squeak 3.10 release management



## Pharo as a fork of Squeak

Initially called Sapphire

In april discussion about a new name (Sapphire as well as Diamond)  

Analogy of a Lighthouse, a system that brings stability and that guides developers in the storms of their research.

"Project Description

Pharo: towards a professional open-source Smalltalk. Aka burn the disc pack. Pharo wants to take a fresh look at the Smalltalk philosophy and current implementations. The idea is to produce a set of good packages that will be able to be loaded on a micro/tiny kernel. Pharo manisfesto -Better for the better -Beauty to learn from -Not backward compatible -Clean, lean and fast"

## And beyond

One should not be shy to mention that the fork of Pharo from the Squeak system also created mixed feelings and raised different voices in the community. Some community members have seen Pharo as affront on the Squeak open source movement accusing the Pharo people to have divided the community in two parts or Pharo not trying to stay compatible anymore with the original.

But even before and after Pharo the were other forks of Squeak available (like Etoys, OpenCobalt, Cuis, Spoon and many other) with own interests and sometimes own communities. Pharo was and still is the most radical change compared to the original Squeak code base. 
 
Even with all these forks Squeak itself is still alive and well with a reduced but active community having provided several releases in the last years too. For sure it will not happen to get all these different interests under one umbrella again.

But a very essential step for a common and stable coexistence was the unification on the VM layer with the [**"OpenSmalltalk VM"**](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk) initiative to reunite VM code forks and provide a common cross-platform virtual machine for Squeak, Pharo, Cuis, and Newspeak.
